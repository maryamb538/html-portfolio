<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey! I'm a Student currently residing in Dubai. im 16 years old, and i love everything that has to do with programmig and also everything about space. I admire Elon musk regarding his accomplishments and everthing he invented. I'm currently in the 10th year of high school and am gonna change shcools next year. My Dream is to either become an aerospace engineer or start something in the field of estate and sales, as this would generate me a good amount of income.</p> 
<p>I'm very passionate about the things i love and i'm also really ambitious. I love sports such as basketball and tennis, i often practice these in my free time. I live wiht my dad and stepmum in a house, where i have my own room and bathroom, somehting completely difernet to my previous lifestyle in germany. As im writingthis about me text i notcie that i didnt yet mention where i'm from. so I was born and raised in germany, my dad is originally from tunisa and my mom from malaysia.</p> 
<p> I went to tunisia before a few times, malaysia never. I'd wish to travel the world when i'm done with school. It would enable me to get to know more people and to experience more cultures and environments. That's it about me for now. If there's anything to add in the future i'll write it in here. Bye :)
